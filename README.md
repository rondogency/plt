Project TuSimple

The TuSimple language is a programming language which makes coding graphs as simple as drawing graphs on paper. It provides a more intuitive way of creating and manipulating graph. With the help of real-time rendering, construction and manipulation of graphs becomes really easy.
Another design principle is to simplify the expression of graph according to its mathematical definition. In other words, user of TuSimple would be able to implement graph algorithms directly from those pseudo code in textbooks(e.g. Introduction to Algorithms). By eliminating the details, user could be more focus on mathematical thoughts in essence, which would definitely improve the efficiency.
